 persistence collection mapping
 
 /* -------------------------------------- | what is persistence collection | --------------------------------------- */
 
 The word persistence in programming means the data still exist, even after the application is closed, by storing the
 data into an database or something like that.
 
 Thus in we are allowed to have java collections like lists, sets and maps whose elements are composed of persistent 
 objects, which made and and added to the collection will exist after the mapping is closed
