 Mapping annotations explained
 
 
 @Entity ---- >
 
 An @Entity means that this class is able to persist, therefore a table showed exist in the database, and that this
 class will be a class representation of the table in the database.
 
 @Table(name=) ---- >
 
 The @Table(name =) annotation allows us to decide which table to connect to.
 
 @ID --- >
 
 This connects the varaiable that is the primary key of the class to the primary of the table.
 
 @Column(name=) --- > 
 
 This annotation allows us to connect a the variable to a particular column. Without using the @column(), hibernate
 will automatically create copyies of the variable that will become the columns in the table.
